# Gugu's Portfolio (v2)

> A personal website project to learn and explore HTML, CSS, and modern frontend tools — one clear step at a time.

## 📌 Purpose

This project is my safe space to:

- Learn React, TypeScript, and frontend development from the ground up
- Practice writing clean, semantic HTML and CSS
- Build something real, slowly but intentionally
- Pause when needed and pick up where I left off — no shame, no rush

## 📁 Status

- 🏗️ Landing page coming along nicely  
- ✅ Basic HTML/CSS/JS setup complete - Currently writting CSS code using the BEM naming convention 
- 📅 Iterative issues created in GitHub to track milestones

## 🛠️ Tools I'm Learning With

- [x] HTML & Semantic HTML  
- [x] CSS + custom utility classes  
- [ ] Responsive design  
- [ ] TypeScript  
- [ ] React  
- [ ] Vite  
- [ ] Testing (TDD-style approach)

## 🎯 Milestone Philosophy

I’m using small GitHub issues as bite-sized checkpoints. Each one is:
- Focused on a single concept
- Written to be beginner-friendly
- Designed so I can stop and start without losing track

## 📬 Future Plans

- Add a responsive layout
- Style sections with utility-first patterns
- Slowly introduce React + TS concepts
- Explore component-based structure
- Add contact form + deploy
